`PlanarGraph V E F` witnesses a connected planar graph with
`V` vertices, `E` edges, and `F` faces (including outer face).

Built by three elementary plane-graph operations that each preserve
the Euler invariant `V - E + F = 2`:

- `point`   — a single vertex in the plane  (1, 0, 1)
- `addLeaf` — attach a pendant vertex+edge  (V+1, E+1, F)
- `addEdge` — split a face with a new edge  (V, E+1, F+1)

/--
**K₅ is not planarly embeddable** (with simple faces, i.e. each face
bounded by ≥ 3 edges — guaranteed since K₅ has no loops or multi-edges).

Full chain:
1. K₅ has V=5 (Fintype.card_fin)
2. K₅ has E=10 (by kernel computation)
3. Any PlanarEmbedding with 3·F ≤ 2·10 would need F=7 (Euler), but 3·7=21>20. ⊥
